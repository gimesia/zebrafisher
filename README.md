### Quantitative morphological analysis pipeline for microscope images of irradiated zebrafish embryos

This repository is the implementation of the process explained in my B.Sc. thesis work @ University of Szeged

## Required PyPI packages

- numpy
- SciPy
- Scikit-Image
- OpenCV
- circle-fit
- czi-file
- matplotlib
- (Jupyter)

# Manual

Example images are included in ``src/images/examples``

1. Copy the image files into ``src/images/in`` folder
2. Run 'main.py'
3. Wait for the analysing process to run
4. Analysis results are stored in the designated csv file in ``src/images``

Saving and showing the result image is set to True by default, but can be turned off in the calling of the main
executing function.

``` python
"""src/main.py 145:5"""
run_pipeline_for_all_images(save=True, batch_name="", popups=True)
```

The processes are visualised in Jupyter Notebook files in the 'well', 'fish', and 'measure' packages
